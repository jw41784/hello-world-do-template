## Recent Work (April 2025)

- 🔄 **Backend Refactoring**:
  - ✅ Reorganized backend code structure
  - ✅ Created dedicated API directory with route handlers
  - ✅ Improved separation of concerns
  - ✅ Moved utility functions to dedicated files
  - ✅ Created improved documentation

- 🔄 **Frontend Rebuild Attempt**:
  - ✅ Created new React components based on wine-themed design system
  - ✅ Implemented routing and authentication structure
  - ✅ Built detailed wine management pages
  - ✅ Added cache-busting mechanism
  - ❌ Deployment issues: Frontend still showing old version at wine-rater.pages.dev

## Production Issues

- ⚠️ **Frontend Deployment**:
  - The rebuilt frontend is not properly displaying in production
  - Current deployed version still shows "Vinolini" title instead of "Wine Rater"
  - Cache clearing methods don't resolve the issue
  - Local development server works but doesn't connect to production API

- ⚠️ **Cache and Language Issues**:
  - Attempted multiple cache-busting techniques without success
  - Created special cache-clear.html and language.html pages for troubleshooting

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Frontend Deployment Troubleshooting**:
   - Verify Cloudflare Pages deployment credentials and settings
   - Check deployment logs for errors
   - Possibly set up a new Pages project to avoid conflicts
   - Test with a simpler frontend to isolate the issue

2. **Backend Verification**:
   - Test the refactored backend API endpoints separately
   - Verify Durable Object bindings and connections
   - Check for any deployment issues with the backend

3. **Development Environment**:
   - Set up proper local development environment with reliable connections
   - Create development scripts for easier testing

4. **Documentation**:
   - Continue improving documentation of the system architecture
   - Document deployment procedures and troubleshooting steps

## Technical Debt and Optimizations

- Authentication system needs more robust error handling
- Implementation of more secure password hashing
- Add comprehensive test suite for backend and frontend
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Create backup and recovery strategy
- ✅ Implement cache-busting system for frontend assets
- ✅ Address language/locale issues in deployment
- ✅ Improved code organization and architecture
